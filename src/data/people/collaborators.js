            Engineering and Management, in 1995, at FEUP. She completed the internship at Sonae Indústria, in
            the area of Planning and Production Control. The Master was achieved in University of Minho in 1999,
            in Computer Integrated Manufacturing, developing the thesis in Network of companies working
            in Just-in-Time supplying through analytical and simulation models. The PhD was completed in FEUP,
            in 2007, developing a System for Evaluation and Improvement Performance in the Retailing Sector,
            using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique, within a project to evaluate the performance of
            food based stores from Sonae Distribuição. Afterwards, several research projects have been developed
            at the level of performance assessment of multiple organizational units (DEA) in various sectors,
            namely, third sector, renewable energy utilities and energy efficiency of European countries.
